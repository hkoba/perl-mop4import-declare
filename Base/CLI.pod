=head1 DESCRIPTION

Now superceded by L<MOP4Import::Base::CLI_JSON>.

MOP4Import::Base::CLI is a general purpose base class to make
L<your module also runnable from CLI easily|MOP4Import::intro_runnable_module>.
It helps you writing modules with small testable pieces codes.

It provides enough useful default implementation of C<run()> method
for CLI invocation.

Also, this module is implemented using L<MOP4Import|MOP4Import::Declare>
so that you can implement your own C<import()> pragmas.
